                What's going on everyone! My name is Kyle Amerjan. I'm happy to be here in BYU-I for my 3rd semester! I love meeting new people, constantly learning, and trying out new hobbies.
                I love cool cars, finances, running, listening to music (EDM, Modern Pop, Hard Rock, Metal), and working hard. I am a CIT major and hope to score a great tech career someday.
                I am always striving to improve both temporally and spiritually. I previously served a mission in Veracruz, Mexico.
                I am very excited to see what the future has in store for us all!
